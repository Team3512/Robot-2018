# FRC team 3512's 2018 robot

Source code for the 2018 comp robot: Diakoptis

Source code also for the 2018 practice robot: Polybius

## Game

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by
tilting a switch and a scale into your favor. The longer you hold the
witch and scale the more points you get. The switch is low to the
ground and the scale is much higher to reach. As well the end game
involves climbing and in our instance, often times with another robot
on our back. We decided to do all of the game with a pawl system and
a CPU (cube picker upper, these naming conventions are on point). In
autonomous the main goal was to be able to score in all of the various
positions as well as in all goals.
